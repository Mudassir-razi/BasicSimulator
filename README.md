# BasicSimulator
This is a circuit simulator based on my previous work (Node). Node can simulate simple circuit using netlist input. It was written in C++. BS is built on same principal but using different system. It uses schematics to take a network input. Simulator engine then loops throgh each component and makes a system of equations. Each component model has it's own behavior for the equation matrix. They update the matrix according to their properties and keep track of how they can find their post-simulation properties.
